pyS3FS: Access your S3 buckets like they're native files
========================================================

Platforms like `Heroku _<https://heroku.com/>`_ don't allow for FUSE filesystem
usage, so I had to get a bit creative.

Introducing, **pyS3FS**, a library that mocks out all standard Python library
system file operations, allowing you to use alreadyâ€“written code to interface
with Amazon S3.

Usage
-----

``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` and ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` are expected to be set::

    $ AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxxxxxxxxx
    $ AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxx

Create a ``test`` key on S3, with the contents of ``hello``::

    with S3FS(bucket_name='media.kennethreitz.com', mount_point='/app/data') as fs:

        with open('/app/data/test', 'w') as f:
            f.write('hello')
